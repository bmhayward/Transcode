# Transcode
Tools to batch transcode and process videos

## About
Transcode is a set of tools to batch transcode Blu-ray Discs and DVDs into a smaller, more portable format while remaining high enough quality to be mistaken for the originals. Transcode is a wrapper that builds upon Don Meltonâ€™s exceptional video transcoding toolset.

## Requirements
Most of the tools in this package require other software to function properly. Transcode Setup Assistant will install these command line programs:

- ```aliasPath```
- ```atomicparsely``` 
- ```ffmpeg```
- ```filebot``` 
- ```handbrakecli``` 
- ```Homebrew``` 
- ```Java``` 
- ```mkvtoolnix``` 
- ```mplayer```
- ```rsync```
- ```ruby``` 
- ```tag``` 
- ```terminal-notifier```
- ```transcode_video```
- ```Xcode command-line tools```

In addition, a Blu-ray or DVD [reader](www.amazon.com/Samsung-External-Blu-ray-SE-506CB-RSBD/dp/B00JJGFRIQ/ref=pd_sim_147_4?ie=UTF8&dpID=21l0PtOb6GL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR160,160_&refRID=02K1BF563A1RE2C79GV5) is recommended.
